**In Progress**

The current workflow for pruning and intersectect as many SNPs associated with both metabolites and Trait of interest

1) plink to find metabolite snps in ld with trait of interest snps
2) snps 10-5 for metabolites
3) Intersect with the CAD SNPs
4) use swiss to prune the dataset down ( We will use the metabolite p-value as the preferred p-value to select the representative on)
