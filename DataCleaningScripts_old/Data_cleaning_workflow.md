<h2>Data cleaning workflow</h2>

This is a brief description of our data cleaning process at the back-end.
The intermediate dataset generated by this workflow will be the input files of our next step in the pipeline: LD pruning.

### 1. Obtaining GWAS data:
<h4>CAD GWAS</h4>

[**CAD - CARDIoGRAM plus C4d 1000G based GWAS (additive)**](http://www.cardiogramplusc4d.org/data-downloads/ )

[CARDIoGRAMplusC4D Consortium](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3396 )

<h4>Metabolite GWAS - urine</h4>

[Raffler et al. 2015 study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26352407 )

Metabolite profiling was by NMR (Chenomx)
(ChenomxID was mapped to KEGG id)
<h4>Metabolite GWAS - serum<h4>

[Shin et al. 2014 study](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ng.2982 )

Metabolite profiling was by MS (Metabolon)

[**Metabolites: Serum & Urine**](http://metabolomics.helmholtz-muenchen.de/gwas/index.php?task=download )

### 2. Merge shin et. al association output files
	 ./merge_gwas_assoc.sh

### 3. Filter the data with a P-value threshold
Currently the P-value threshold was set to 10^-5.

	 ./filter_data_pval.pl <association_file> <Pvalue_cutoff> <cad | serum | urine>
  
The output file from this step will be formatted to be suitable for the LD pruning process.

### 4.(optional) Obtain a subset of SNPs that present in both the CAD and the metabolite datasets
	 ./get_intersect_snps.pl <trait_assoc_file> <metab_assoc_file> <serum | urine>
