# Web interface for BACON OR CATMINT

## INPUTS
The user will need to select three inputs from drop-down menus:
  1. Metabolite of interest
  2. Tissue in which metabolite-SNP association data was collected
  3. Outcome of interest
  
 
 Â 
## OUTPUTS
The user will be able to view three plots:
  1. MR-tests plot: This plot will provide the user with confidence intervals of overall effect sizes calculated by 5 Mendelian randomisation tests for their sizes for their metabolite and outcome.
  2. Funnel plot: This plot 
  3. Forest plot: This plot will provide confidence intervals for individual SNPs.
